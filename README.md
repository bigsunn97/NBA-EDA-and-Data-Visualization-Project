# NBA-EDA-and-Data-Visualization-Project

In this project I analyzed NBA games data from 2004-2019 to analyze a few NBA related questions. 

The first was whether or not home court advantage really makes a difference in the NBA. I discovered that home teams on average score more points and have a higher Field Goal % than Road teams, winning between 55-60% of all games played. However, FT% and Three Point % is unnaffected.

I also analyzed Kobe and Lebron's careers, specifically their respective relationships between points and Field Goal %. The scatter plot shows that although Kobe had more instances of scoring more than 40+ points, Lebron on average has a higher FG% percentage and a tighter dispersion of points scored.

Finally I analyzed how many games teams won over 2004-2019. The graph shows that the Spurs have been the most successful team over the past 15 years and the Hornets being the least successful in terms of games won.
